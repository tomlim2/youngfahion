          For me, fashion is not about status. it's about Authenticity. I still remember the last time I went to Barney's New York. As soon as I went in, The sales people gathered around me with all kinds of design cloth on hangers and ask me to try them on, which ever garment I put on they always compliment me with fancy words. I don't think they are sincere. After I handed them back to the sales, I can feel the disappoint and disgusting from their eyes. I felt been forced to make involuntary purchase. It mades me question. The purpose of my purchase is it to please the sales people.
          <br><br>
          On the other hand, I got to know thrift store like goodwill only in recent years. The first time I went to Goodwill was a homework assignment for our design class. I felt uncomfortable upon entry the store. To be honest, I've gotten used to going to fancy department stores with lots of trendy, new cloth. There were people of all ages in the store. Among them I noticed a costumer who was carefully looking through the cloth. whose price tags were only two or three bucks. I think he was thoughtful about his outfit. despite the smuggest on his cloth which made me feel a little bit uneasy. I feel wrong about touching the cloth, In case they hadn't be sanitized thoroughly. It wasn't until two month later that I return to Goodwill and made my first thrift purchase, which I still wear often nowadays. From then on this garment changed my opinion on shopping in thrift store.
          <br><br>
          I think authenticity is fashionable regardless of the price tag. Nowadays I visit Goodwill more and more often, Because I feel a sense of ease that Barneys New York failed to provide me. There is no deception. If I need any thing I can ask the Goodwill stuff, or we can call them security. And they will help me without ingratiation. I really enjoy this kind of shopping experience. To me fashion should make people feel safe & secure while freely expressing their personal style.
